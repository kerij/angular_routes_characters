      <div id="col1content">
        <p>Harry Potter was born on the 31st of July in 1980 to parents Lily and James Potter. He was born a wizard and into a magical family. He has black hair, blue eyes and impaired vision, requiring glasses. His fathers best friend, Sirius Black, was made Harry's godfather when he was a baby.</p>

        <p>During the First Wizarding War, when he was only one year old, Voldemort attempted to kill Harry but failed. First James tried to block his path and was murdered, then Lily shielded Harry giving him the ultimate protection; love. The curse rebounded and Voldemort ceased to exist in physical form, while Lily was killed in the process and Harry was left completely unharmed with the exception of a lightening shaped scar on his forehead, making him 'The Boy Who Lived'. Harry was then collected by Rubeus Hagrid and they traveled to Surrey, where they met Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall. They left Harry on the doorstep of Lily's muggle sister (Petunia)'s house with a letter explaining what had happened. Reluctantly taking him in, Petunia and her husband Vernon raised Harry along side their son Dudley. Harry grew up being borderline abused and forced to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs. He was told at an early age that his parents were killed in a car accident, he also knew nothing of being a wizard or the magical world.</p>

        <p>While on a trip to the zoo for Dudley's 11th birthday, he discovered he could talk to a snake. He accidentally made the glass for the snake's enclosure disappear, setting the snake free. Harry tried to assure his uncle he didn't do anything, but Vernon knowing the truth of his powers locked him in the cupboard when they arrived home. The next day Harry received a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that he started to open but was interrupted when Dudley snatched it from him, then Vernon destroyed it. He was sent numerous letters, never getting to read them, then one Sunday, their house magically started to fill with letters. Vernon ordered all four of them to move to an island to escape until the morning of Harry's 11th birthday, where Hagrid arrived and gave Harry a copy of the letter. He read the letter learning he had been accepted to Hogwarts as a student, and learnt the truth of his parents death and his magical powers. He left with Hagrid to go to Diagon Alley, where he collected school supplies, including an owl he named Hedwig. In the alley, Harry met Olivander, a wand expert, shop owner and salesman, whom sold him his first wand. Hagrid then walked Harry halfway to Platform 9 3/4 leaving him to find his own way. Confused, he asked for help from then stranger Molly Weasley, whom helped him onto the platform by instructing him to run into a wall. To his surprise he appeared on the platform and boarded the Hogwarts Express.</p>
